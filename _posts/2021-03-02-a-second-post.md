Can I reference the first blogpost?

According to these instructions it should be possible [linking to other posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts)

Lets see. 
 - With prefix [My First Post]({% post_url /github-pages-with-jekyll/2021-03-02-hello-world %}) 
 - Without prefix [My First Post]({% post_url 2021-03-02-hello-world %}) 

Now I'm still confused, but on a higher level.
