Can I reference the first blogpost?

According to these instructions it should be possible [linking to other posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts)

Lets see. [My First Post]({% post_url _posts/2021-03-02-hello-world %}) 

I think that the path `_posts` was missing from the reference.
